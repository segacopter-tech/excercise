# excercise
making a project to publish here? lets go over the options for your project.

# type
is it docs or is it a programming project OR is it something about hardware? you can put all of these on here but docs

have to be put on here and on the website. also if your making documentation for your project you dont have to put it on your website you can just put it in the github repo. but you should use the

[segacopter project docs](https://github.com/segacopter-tech/excercise/blob/main/tools/docs.py) generator script in the [tools](https://github.com/segacopter-tech/excercise/tree/main/tools) section of this repo.

# lang
is it web (html, javascript, or css) python, c++ OR is it arduino? figure this out. becuase this is important in your project passing THE SEGACOPTER as good to make. unless youre the person writing this. you go ahead and

make projects.

# excercise
making a project to publish here? lets go over the options for your project.

# type
is it docs or is it a programming project OR is it something about hardware? you can put all of these on here but docs
have to be put on here and on the website.

# lang
is it web (html, javascript, or css) python, c++ OR is it arduino? figure this out. becuase this is important in your project passing THE SEGACOPTER as good to make. unless youre the person writing this. you go ahead and make projects.
